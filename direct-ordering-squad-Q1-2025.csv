DO-226,Direct Order Squad,[Editor-API] Automated Subdomain Generation for Business Onboarding,"## Description

Automate the generation of subdomains in the format {biz_name}.order.urbanpiper.com during the business onboarding process. 

- [X] Validate domain strings to avoid special characters or any other characters that might not be acceptable in an URL.
- [X] Ensure uniqueness of subdomains to prevent duplicates. This could be a rare case and we don't know if codex allows this, will put up a check just in case.
- [ ] ~~Append a suffix to any auto-generated duplicate domain, merchant will anyways have an option to modify it later. (still in discussion)~~
- [ ] ~~Create a subdomain validation endpoint, that will do the following~~ 
  - [ ] ~~Check if the subdomain already exists~~
  - [ ] ~~Validates subdomain~~

    

### Additional Notes

* For starters we are gonna set this up  and are gonna use the existing domains. The final domain we are gonna use for `biz_name`.urbanpiperdomain.com is not decided yet. For this to change, we will need some help from Infra squad.

DO-242,Direct Order Squad,[Infra] Cleanup pending certification requests for Meraki Websites,"### Description

Recently, we encountered a problem where newly added domains could not connect to our websites. This issue primarily stemmed from a backlog of pending SSL requests, with the queue reaching its maximum capacity of 60 requests. The pending requests occurred because domains were added but not configured on the hosting site

The reasons for the queue backlog included:

* Merchants starting the onboarding process but not completing it.
* Merchants adding multiple domains but only configuring the primary one, leaving the additional domains unconfigured and stuck in the queue.

For now Azaan has increased the queue from 60 to 120 but we still need to clean up the pending requests

There are two ways to do it

* Either ask the merchant to configure their pending domains properly
* Delete websites whose businesses are inactive

Cleanup Sheet for reference:

DO-227,Direct Order Squad,[Meraki-API] Optimize cart queries,"## Description

We're doing a query to update all carts as pushed_to_kafka=true. But there seems to not be a where condition on this. This obviously seems incorrect: 

* There can be a race condition where a new cart was added, between the last read and the update
* A better approach will be update by created timestamp or ids of carts pushed, to ensure we only update the right ones.

The query is also super inefficient because it's updating all 70k rows right now, even a query of where pushed_to_kafka=false, will reduce that a lot, cause there's a index.

The issue is that it's not using pushed_to_kafka index, which would be much more efficient, since there would only be few documents with it false. If we can add a mongodb index hint, to use that index, this query will become much faster as well.

DO-259,Direct Order Squad,Issue: Incorrect Address Handling During Order Placement,"### 🐞 What's going wrong?

When a user selects a store based on their current location (e.g., IRV Centre, Bengaluru) and then adds a different address (e.g., Kolkata) before placing the order, the system allows the order to be placed. However, the final address displayed is a mix of both locations (half Bengaluru and half Kolkata). 
The system is failing to validate address changes correctly, leading to incorrect order placement

#### **Expected Result:**

* When a user changes the address after selecting a store, the system should validate the new address by checking the location or pincode.
* If the new address is outside the serviceable area of the selected store, an error message should appear:
  **""Sorry, but we are unable to provide service at your location at this time!""**
* The order should not be allowed to proceed with mismatched addresses.

#### **Actual Result:**

* The order is getting placed despite the address being a mix of the old and new locations.
* The system does not validate the new address or restrict the order placement.

DO-249,Direct Order Squad,Order Placement UI Stuck in Loading State,"### 🐞 What's going wrong?

After placing an order, the UI shows a loading state instead of displaying a confirmation or order details. However, when checking the **Past Orders** section, the order has already been placed successfully.

#### **Description:**

This issue occurs when an order is placed, but the UI doesn’t update to reflect the successful placement. Instead, it stays stuck in the loading state, confusing users. Despite this, the order is actually placed and visible under **Past Orders**.

**Expected Result**: Once an order is successfully placed, the UI should immediately update to show a confirmation message or display the order details, leaving no ambiguity about the order's status.

**Actual Result**: The UI remains in a loading state after the order is placed, causing confusion. The order is successfully placed and visible in the **Past Orders** section, but the user doesn't receive proper feedback in the UI.

DO-259,Direct Order Squad,Issue: Incorrect Address Handling During Order Placement,"### 🐞 What's going wrong?

When a user selects a store based on their current location (e.g., IRV Centre, Bengaluru) and then adds a different address (e.g., Kolkata) before placing the order, the system allows the order to be placed. However, the final address displayed is a mix of both locations (half Bengaluru and half Kolkata). 
The system is failing to validate address changes correctly, leading to incorrect order placement

#### **Expected Result:**

* When a user changes the address after selecting a store, the system should validate the new address by checking the location or pincode.
* If the new address is outside the serviceable area of the selected store, an error message should appear:
  **""Sorry, but we are unable to provide service at your location at this time!""**
* The order should not be allowed to proceed with mismatched addresses.

#### **Actual Result:**

* The order is getting placed despite the address being a mix of the old and new locations.
* The system does not validate the new address or restrict the order placement.

Currently we don't show the what exactly is missing in the domain configuration while we do have the data in the response of our API. Most of the time either the `arecords` or `cname` are not configured properly.

 

### Why do this?

We keep on getting EOC tickets around domain configuration, ideally we should show the issues on the UI so that Merchants/Account Manager/ Support team can resolve these by themselves without tech intervention.

DO-249,Direct Order Squad,Order Placement UI Stuck in Loading State,"### 🐞 What's going wrong?

After placing an order, the UI shows a loading state instead of displaying a confirmation or order details. However, when checking the **Past Orders** section, the order has already been placed successfully.

#### **Description:**

This issue occurs when an order is placed, but the UI doesn’t update to reflect the successful placement. Instead, it stays stuck in the loading state, confusing users. Despite this, the order is actually placed and visible under **Past Orders**.

**Preconditions:
Biz Details:** 
**Piper Cafe by UrbanPiper**
Business ID: **76720224

***Environment Details***

* Platform: Windows 11
* Browser: Chrome 
* Device: Laptop

---

**Expected Result**: Once an order is successfully placed, the UI should immediately update to show a confirmation message or display the order details, leaving no ambiguity about the order's status.

**Actual Result**: The UI remains in a loading state after the order is placed, causing confusion. The order is successfully placed and visible in the **Past Orders** section, but the user doesn't receive proper feedback in the UI.

**Expected Result**: The description should expand dynamically without interfering with adjacent elements. Proper spacing, wrapping, or a scroll option should be implemented to maintain a clean and readable layout.

DO-234,Direct Order Squad,Order Placement and Payment Mode Switching Not Functioning Properly,"### 🐞 What's going wrong?

When attempting to place an order, the button does not work as expected and remains in a loading state indefinitely. Additionally, trying to switch the payment mode also triggers continuous loading without completing the action.

📝**Tell me more about this BUG🐞**
The order placement button and the payment mode switching functionality are unresponsive. Instead of processing the action, the system enters a persistent loading state, preventing users from completing their transactions.

***Environment Details***

* Platform: Windows 11
* Device: Desktop
* Version: (e.g., v2.3.1)

---

**Expected Result**: 

1. Clicking the order placement button should immediately process the order and provide confirmation or error feedback within a few seconds.
2. Changing the payment mode should swiftly update the payment method without unnecessary delays.

**Actual Result**: 

1. The order placement button initiates a loading animation but does not complete the order placement.
2. Switching payment modes triggers a similar loading state, with no update or completion.

When a user presses the **back button** from the payment page to return to the cart, the page enters an **endless loading state**. This prevents users from proceeding further, blocking them from modifying their cart or completing the order.

📝**Tell me more about this BUG🐞**
During the checkout process, if a user decides to return to the cart by pressing the back button, the system becomes unresponsive and continues to load indefinitely. This disrupts the user experience and forces them to restart the process, potentially leading to frustration and abandoned orders.

**Expected Result**:
Pressing the **back button** from the payment page should seamlessly redirect users to the cart.

* Users should be able to modify the cart and continue the checkout process without delays or errors.

**Actual Result**:

* Users cannot proceed to payment again or finalize their order without refreshing or restarting the session.

DO-207,Direct Order Squad,Invalid Card and Valid Card Validation Fails During Order Placement,"### 🐞 What's going wrong?

When placing an order using invalid card and valid card details, the system processes the order as if the card is valid. The order proceeds to placement and subsequently gets cancelled in Atlas. This creates unnecessary order processing and cancellation steps, leading to operational inefficiencies. This is happening with valid and invalid card details. 

📝**Tell me more about this BUG🐞**
The system currently does not differentiate between valid and invalid card details during order placement. Regardless of the card's validity, the order goes through, and later, Atlas cancels it. This issue affects payment reliability and can result in order tracking discrepancies.

**Preconditions:**

Open Prime->Select Atlas

Business for testing (Staging)

Biz: Subway Mexico UAT (in use)

ID: 86833653

UP Location ID: 42626

Go to Meraki-> Workspace-> Preview

***Environment Details***

* Platform: Windows 11
* Browser: Chrome
* Device: Laptop

---

**Expected Result**: 
Orders should only be placed when valid card details are entered.

* If the card details are invalid, the system should block order placement and display an appropriate error message to the user.
* If the card details are valid, the system should proceed with the order placement and in order history it should be visible as successful to the user.

**Actual Result**: 
Orders are being placed with both valid and invalid card details.

* Orders placed with invalid card details get automatically cancelled in Atlas after processing.
  
  Order placed with valid card details automatically cancelled in Atlas after processing.

ORD-462,Order Squad,Incorrect Order Amount Display in Order History,"### 🐞 What's going wrong?

The order value in the order history is displayed incorrectly with the decimal point in the wrong position. This causes the order amount to appear significantly lower than the actual value. For example, if the order value is MX$49.40, it is shown as MX$0.494 in the order history, which is misleading.

📝**Tell me more about this BUG🐞**
The system seems to misinterpret the order value by shifting the decimal point by two places, causing the amount to be incorrectly scaled down. This may stem from incorrect handling of currency formatting or rounding logic during the recording or display process.

---

**Expected Result**: The order history should correctly display the order value as MX$49.40 without shifting the decimal point.

**Actual Result**: The order history displays the order value as MX$0.494 instead of MX$49.40.

DO-227,Direct Order Squad,[Meraki-API] Optimize cart queries,"## Description

We're doing a query to update all carts as pushed_to_kafka=true. But there seems to not be a where condition on this. This obviously seems incorrect: 

* There can be a race condition where a new cart was added, between the last read and the update
* A better approach will be update by created timestamp or ids of carts pushed, to ensure we only update the right ones.

The query is also super inefficient because it's updating all 70k rows right now, even a query of where pushed_to_kafka=false, will reduce that a lot, cause there's a index.

another query that's slow is this: [https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/66d97e86f0a8301d0706bb04#/metrics/replicaSet/66d981f4590ef12099612c1e/queryInsights/profiler/details/meraki_prod.cartmodels/query](https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/66d97e86f0a8301d0706bb04#/metrics/replicaSet/66d981f4590ef12099612c1e/queryInsights/profiler/details/meraki_prod.cartmodels/query) 

The issue is that it's not using pushed_to_kafka index, which would be much more efficient, since there would only be few documents with it false. If we can add a mongodb index hint, to use that index, this query will become much faster as well.

DO-229,Direct Order Squad,[App]Order Placement Allowed Despite Store Being Closed,"### 🐞 What's going wrong?

The system allows orders to be placed in the app even when the store is marked as closed. This creates operational confusion and could lead to customer dissatisfaction or failed order fulfillment.🙋 How was this reported?

📝**Tell me more about this BUG🐞**
The app should prevent users from placing orders if the store status is marked as ""closed."" However, despite the store being closed, the app still permits the user to proceed with order placement.

**Preconditions:**

Installed the app
Subway
v23.00(526)

***Environment Details***

* Device: Android 

---

**Expected Result**: 
When the store is marked as closed:

1. The app should display a message informing users that the store is closed and not accepting orders.
2. The ""Place Order"" button should be disabled or hidden.

**Actual Result**: 

The app allows users to proceed with placing orders even when the store is closed. There is no warning or restriction in place.

DO-241,Direct Order Squad,Update CNAME Configuration in Meraki Domains Tab,"## 🌟 ""Why"" it is to be done?

Currently, the CNAME displayed in the Meraki Domains tab is `meraki-web-9t6k.web.meraki.zone`, which is incorrect and causes issues when users attempt to connect their custom domains. As all the new biz will be on ArgoCD, the correct CNAME should be `http://meraki-dns.urbanpiper.com` to ensure seamless domain connectivity. This update is crucial to prevent user frustration and ensure a smooth domain setup process.

#### 💹 **Success Metric:**

* **Reduction in Support Tickets:** Decrease in domain-related support tickets by 30%.

## 📃 PM Specs

1. **UI Update:**
   * Replace the current CNAME (`meraki-web-9t6k.web.meraki.zone`) with the correct CNAME (`http://meraki-dns.urbanpiper.com`) in the Domains tab.
   * Ensure the new CNAME is clearly displayed and easily copyable for users.
2. There should not be any impact to the existing businesses that have their custom domains already connected.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [X] The Domains tab now displays `http://meraki-dns.urbanpiper.com` as the CNAME.
- [X] The CNAME is easily copyable
- [X] Existing business are not affected
- [X] Should not effect netlify setups

DO-229,Direct Order Squad,[App]Order Placement Allowed Despite Store Being Closed,"### 🐞 What's going wrong?

The system allows orders to be placed in the app even when the store is marked as closed. This creates operational confusion and could lead to customer dissatisfaction or failed order fulfillment.🙋 How was this reported?

📝**Tell me more about this BUG🐞**
The app should prevent users from placing orders if the store status is marked as ""closed."" However, despite the store being closed, the app still permits the user to proceed with order placement.

**Preconditions:**

Installed the app
Subway
v23.00(526)

***Environment Details***

* Device: Android 

---

**Expected Result**: 
When the store is marked as closed:

1. The app should display a message informing users that the store is closed and not accepting orders.
2. The ""Place Order"" button should be disabled or hidden.

**Actual Result**: 

The app allows users to proceed with placing orders even when the store is closed. There is no warning or restriction in place.

Automate the generation of subdomains in the format {biz_name}.order.urbanpiper.com during the business onboarding process. 

- [X] Validate domain strings to avoid special characters or any other characters that might not be acceptable in an URL.
- [X] Ensure uniqueness of subdomains to prevent duplicates. This could be a rare case and we don't know if codex allows this, will put up a check just in case.
- [ ] ~~Append a suffix to any auto-generated duplicate domain, merchant will anyways have an option to modify it later. (still in discussion)~~
- [ ] ~~Create a subdomain validation endpoint, that will do the following~~ 
  - [ ] ~~Check if the subdomain already exists~~
  - [ ] ~~Validates subdomain~~

* For starters we are gonna set this up  and are gonna use the existing domains. The final domain we are gonna use for `biz_name`.urbanpiperdomain.com is not decided yet. For this to change, we will need some help from Infra squad.

DO-242,Direct Order Squad,[Infra] Cleanup pending certification requests for Meraki Websites,"### Description

Recently, we encountered a problem where newly added domains could not connect to our websites. This issue primarily stemmed from a backlog of pending SSL requests, with the queue reaching its maximum capacity of 60 requests. The pending requests occurred because domains were added but not configured on the hosting site

The reasons for the queue backlog included:

* Merchants starting the onboarding process but not completing it.
* Merchants adding multiple domains but only configuring the primary one, leaving the additional domains unconfigured and stuck in the queue.

For now Azaan has increased the queue from 60 to 120 but we still need to clean up the pending requests

There are two ways to do it

* Either ask the merchant to configure their pending domains properly
* Delete websites whose businesses are inactive

After placing an order, when users return to the page and click the burger menu button to open the side drawer, the drawer does not load smoothly. Instead, it blinks, making it difficult to interact with or view the contents. This impacts the user experience and usability of the menu.

**Expected Result**:

* The side drawer should open smoothly and remain stable when the burger menu button is clicked.
* The behavior of the side drawer should remain consistent and functional, regardless of previous actions like placing an order.

**Actual Result**:

* The side drawer blinks repeatedly when the burger menu button is clicked after placing an order and navigating back to the page.
* The contents of the drawer are not visible or accessible due to the blinking behavior.

The system displays a success message **""Domain set as primary successfully""**, but the selected domain is **not actually marked as Primary**. This indicates a mismatch between the **UI message** and the **backend process**, meaning the primary domain update is either failing or not reflecting properly.

**Description:**
When a user tries to set a custom domain as the primary domain, the system **shows a success message**, but the selected domain **does not get marked as primary** in the UI. This issue can cause confusion as users assume the operation was successful while the domain remains unchanged.

---

### **Expected Result**

* The selected domain should be **correctly marked as Primary**.
* The change should **immediately reflect** in the UI.

---

### **Actual Result**

* The system displays the message: **""Domain set as primary successfully""**.
* However, the selected domain is **not actually updated as Primary**.
* The primary domain remains unchanged in the UI.

#### **Description:**

Whenever an error occurs in the system, the corresponding error message is displayed twice consecutively, leading to redundancy and potential confusion for users. This happens across different modules and for various types of errors.

Here the test steps are: 

1. **Add a Custom Domain**
2. Type same Domain name which is already exists. 
3. check the error msg

DO-304,Direct Order Squad,Primary Domain Gets Deleted Without Any Warning,"### 🐞 What's going wrong?

When attempting to **disconnect a primary domain**, the system **immediately deletes it** without displaying a **warning or confirmation prompt**. This can lead to accidental domain disconnections, potentially disrupting the website's functionality. A proper validation step should be in place to prevent unintended deletions.

**Description**

The system allows users to disconnect a **primary domain** without any **confirmation message or warning**. Since the primary domain is crucial for website accessibility, removing it without confirmation can cause unintended downtime or misconfigurations.

---

### **Expected Result**

* When a user attempts to **disconnect a primary domain**, a **confirmation prompt** should appear:
  **""Are you sure you want to disconnect the primary domain? This action may affect website functionality.""**
* The domain should only be disconnected if the user **explicitly confirms** the action.
* If the domain is disconnected, the system should display a **success message** and allow users to set a new primary domain.

---

### **Actual Result**

* The primary domain gets **deleted immediately** without any **confirmation or warning**.
* There is **no safeguard** to prevent accidental deletion.
* Users are unaware of the consequences before the domain is removed.

We keep on getting EOC tickets around domain configuration, ideally we should show the issues on the UI so that Merchants/Account Manager/ Support team can resolve these by themselves without tech intervention.

DO-303,Direct Order Squad,Primary Domain Not Updating Despite Success Message,"### 🐞 What's going wrong?

The system displays a success message **""Domain set as primary successfully""**, but the selected domain is **not actually marked as Primary**. This indicates a mismatch between the **UI message** and the **backend process**, meaning the primary domain update is either failing or not reflecting properly.

**Description:**
When a user tries to set a custom domain as the primary domain, the system **shows a success message**, but the selected domain **does not get marked as primary** in the UI. This issue can cause confusion as users assume the operation was successful while the domain remains unchanged.

---

### **Expected Result**

* The selected domain should be **correctly marked as Primary**.
* The change should **immediately reflect** in the UI.

---

### **Actual Result**

* The system displays the message: **""Domain set as primary successfully""**.
* However, the selected domain is **not actually updated as Primary**.
* The primary domain remains unchanged in the UI.

DO-304,Direct Order Squad,Primary Domain Gets Deleted Without Any Warning,"### 🐞 What's going wrong?

When attempting to **disconnect a primary domain**, the system **immediately deletes it** without displaying a **warning or confirmation prompt**. This can lead to accidental domain disconnections, potentially disrupting the website's functionality. A proper validation step should be in place to prevent unintended deletions.

**Description**

The system allows users to disconnect a **primary domain** without any **confirmation message or warning**. Since the primary domain is crucial for website accessibility, removing it without confirmation can cause unintended downtime or misconfigurations.

---

### **Expected Result**

* When a user attempts to **disconnect a primary domain**, a **confirmation prompt** should appear:
  **""Are you sure you want to disconnect the primary domain? This action may affect website functionality.""**
* The domain should only be disconnected if the user **explicitly confirms** the action.
* If the domain is disconnected, the system should display a **success message** and allow users to set a new primary domain.

---

### **Actual Result**

* The primary domain gets **deleted immediately** without any **confirmation or warning**.
* There is **no safeguard** to prevent accidental deletion.
* Users are unaware of the consequences before the domain is removed.

Currently we don't show the what exactly is missing in the domain configuration while we do have the data in the response of our API. Most of the time either the `arecords` or `cname` are not configured properly.

 

### Why do this?

We keep on getting EOC tickets around domain configuration, ideally we should show the issues on the UI so that Merchants/Account Manager/ Support team can resolve these by themselves without tech intervention.

DO-333,Direct Order Squad,[App] Previously Applied Coupon Temporarily Visible After Clearing Cart,"**What's Going Wrong?**

When a user adds items to the cart, applies a coupon, then clears the cart and adds a new item, the previously applied coupon is still visible for a few seconds before disappearing. This could cause confusion for users as they might assume the coupon is still applied.

#### **Description**

The coupon should be completely removed from the cart once the cart is cleared. However, after clearing the cart and adding a new item, the old coupon remains visible for a short duration before disappearing. This issue affects user experience, potentially leading to incorrect assumptions about discounts being applied.

#### **Expected Result**

Once the cart is cleared, any applied coupon should be removed immediately and should not be visible when adding new items.

#### **Actual Result**

After clearing the cart and adding a new item, the previously applied coupon remains visible for a few seconds before disappearing.

#### **Environment Details**

* **Platform:** Windows 11 (Web Browser), Android/iOS (Mobile App & Mobile Browser)
* **Browser:** Chrome
* **Device:** Desktop & Mobile Android

DO-331,Direct Order Squad,[Web] Combo Order Validation Bypass,"### 🐞 What's going wrong?

In the combo order feature, users must select 4 pizzas as required. However, on both the web and mobile browser, users can proceed with the order after selecting only 1 pizza instead of the required 4. This leads to incorrect order processing and potential inconsistencies in billing and inventory.

#### **Description**

When placing a combo order, the system should enforce the selection of 4 pizzas before allowing the user to proceed. However, users are currently able to bypass this requirement and continue with fewer selections. This issue affects both the web browser and mobile browser platforms.

#### **Environment Details**

* **Platform:** Windows 11 (Web Browser), (Mobile Browser)
* **Browser:** Chrome
* **Device:** Desktop & Mobile Android
* **App Version:** web- v8.31.1

#### **Expected Result**

The system should validate the selection of 4 pizzas before allowing the user to proceed with the order. If fewer than 4 pizzas are selected, an error message should be displayed, preventing further progress.

#### **Actual Result**

Users are able to proceed with the order even after selecting only 1 pizza instead of the required 4. There is no validation preventing this incorrect selection.
